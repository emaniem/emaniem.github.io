      As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms
      and set out walking once more.

      <span class="underline">I felt deeply moved, and stirred.
      It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>

      <span id="highlight">  It seemed to me, even, that there
        was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>

      As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:

      <span class="textcolor">"What moves me so deeply, about this little
        prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image
        of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of
        a lamp, even when he is asleep.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." </span>

      And I felt &nbsp;him to be more fragile still.

      <span class="underline">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that
        might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
